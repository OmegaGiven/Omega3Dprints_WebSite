				Still in its early stages we are striving to work on different fronts of making the video quality better
				and designing methods for those that want to pursue 3d printing a guidline they can use to make or buy their own printer.

			<h3>Logan Utah Custom prints</h3>
			<p>
				Currently The Omega 3D Prints is based in Logan Utah. All printed products can be found on facebook Marketplace. Most products is based on Dungeons and Dragon styled mini's but any custom print can be requested with respect to time and size of orders.
				Due to copyright and licensing agreements on 3d models. All costs and pricing of custom prints is for labor and material cost and not for the 3D model used to print.

				Currently a work in progress, Omega Earings is a project that is built to be sold on Etsy. Currently in the works of 3D modeling we are designing earings to be printed and sold for a low price of 5$ for 2 sets. These earings will range in style hopeing to include; Wire hooks, Chandelier, Teardrop, Dangle, and drop. We do not have a projected release date but would love to take in ideas which can be sent to Omegaprints3d@gmail.com
